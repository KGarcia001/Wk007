<h3>First Log</h3>

<p>August 10th, 2020</p>  

<p>I currently attend Inver Hills Community College full time as a pseo
  student. I plan to continue <br>  school to become a software engineer but the
  college  I want to do this at is still undecided.  <br> My hobbies consitst of 
  playing video games, sewing, and reading. I like trying <br> new things and
  learning as much as possible but in general there isn't much to me.</p>
