<h3>First Log</h3>

<p>I currently attend Inver Hills Community College full time as a pseo
  student. I plan to continue school to become a software engineer but the
  college I want to do this at is still undecided. My hobbies consitst of
  playing video games, sewing, and reading. I like trying new things and
  learning as much as possible but in general there isn't much to me.</p>
